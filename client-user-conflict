It appears that you have a client named after your user.
This situation causes a conflict and can interfere with the user's permissions.

Please follow the steps below to resolve the conflict.

Replace USERNAME with the username you use to login at manage.opscode.com

1. Login to manage.opscode.com
2. Browse to https://manage.opscode.com/clients/_acl
3. Give the group "clients" the "List" permission
4. Browse to https://manage.opscode.com/clients
5. Delete the USERNAME client
6. Browse to https://manage.opscode.com/clients/_acl
7. Remove the "List" permission from the group "clients"
8. Browse to https://manage.opscode.com/clients and verify you can see a list of your clients

Thanks,

Sean
